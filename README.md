## Overview of the Analysis
  1.  Import data into Tableau.
  2.  Create and style worksheets, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.
  3.  Use Tableau worksheets to display data in a professional way.
  4.  Portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

## Purpose

   Using data from a bike-sharing program to evaluate and visualize trips in New York City. Looking at geographical data, along with disaggreated data by user types, and genders to deteremine if this would be a good investment. The data also includes usage durations, peak usage times, and key target market. 

## Results

  *   According to the checkout times by gender table, most bikers usage time peak between 5 to 10 minutes, before dropping significantly
  *   The trips by gender (weekday by hour) chart reveal that bikes are heavily used from Monday to Friday right before working hours start at 9 am and right after working hours at 5 pm
  *   The trips by gender (weekday by hour) chart reveal that bikes are most heavily used during Thursday from 5 to 6 pm, and 6 to 7 pm
  *   The trips by gender (by weekday) chart reveal that bike usage is heaviest during Thursday and Friday
  *   The trips by gender chart reveal that most bike users are male

## Summary

  *   The results show that the key target market for bike users should be towards males, given their heavy usage in comparison to females and unknown groups
  *   The results show that the key target market for bike users should be towards subscribers, given their heavy usage in comparison to regular customers
  *   The results show that there is an opportunity to maximize and promote longer bike usage per trip, given that most trips last around 5 to minutes
  *   For future analysis, the two following additional visualizations will be beneficial:
        *   Checkout time for users, segregated between subscribers and customers
        *   A trip by weekday chart that combines time when bikes were used, as well as the length before checkout.
